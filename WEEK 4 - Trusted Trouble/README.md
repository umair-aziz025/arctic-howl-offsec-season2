## Attack Chain

```text
Mass applicant email workflow via SMTP (resume.pdf submissions)
    ↓
Hiring manager sends onboarding instructions to accepted users
    ↓
Client hostnames and VPN IP collection campaign
    ↓
Insider-side traffic from CLIENT10 to external endpoint 203.98.112.47 (WireGuard)
    ↓
Internal HTTP staging to 10.10.0.254 with multipart uploads (note1, note2, note3)
    ↓
note2 leaks password hint: "Don't forget P@$$w0rd!"
    ↓
note3 is actually encrypted 7z payload
    ↓
Recovered sensitive.db (SQLite users table)
    ↓
Exfiltrated credential confirmed: Robin Schwartz / 5up3r5Tr0NgP@$$w0rd!
```
