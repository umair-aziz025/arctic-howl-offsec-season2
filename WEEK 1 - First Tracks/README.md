## Challenge Overview

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Status** | ✅ COMPLETED |
| **Category** | Malware Analysis · PCAP Forensics · Incident Response |
| **Difficulty** | Easy |
| **Event** | Arctic Howl: The Cascade Expanse — Season 2 |
| **Score** | 40 / 40 |

## 📋 Scenario

At the Cascade Law Archive, the IT department detected a sudden cold spike in outbound network traffic shortly after onboarding a new developer. While the firm primarily operates on Windows systems, the new hire requested a Mac laptop. The developer reports no intentional software downloads, but confirms cloning a starter Xcode project from an internal Git repository as part of onboarding.

**File Provided:** `capture.pcap` (ZIP password: `3531e680028eb73989f3a3b2ce129241`)

## 🎯 Questions

| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 1 | What URL did the malware download the first stage from? What user-agent sent the request? |
| 2 | How does the C2 server obfuscate its payloads? |
| 3 | Analyze the `looz` payload. What information does it extract from the victim machine? |
| 4 | Analyze the `cozfi_xhh` payload. What information does it extract from the victim machine? |
| 5 | How does the malware attempt to infect other devices? Which payload is responsible? |
| 6 | What file contained the initial malware? How is the initial payload obfuscated? |

## 🔍 Key Findings

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Q1 — Initial Download** | `http://bu1knames.io/a` via `curl/8.7.1` |
| **Q2 — Obfuscation** | 7× nested Base64 in AppleScript payloads |
| **Q3 — looz Payload** | Exfiltrates browser, macOS version, Safari version, locale, firewall status, SIP status, CPU info → POST to `/i` |
| **Q4 — cozfi_xhh** | Exfiltrates Apple Notes + Reminders, serial number → ZIP upload to `/n?s=<serial>` |
| **Q5 — Propagation** | `jez` payload injects malicious pre-commit hooks into all local Git repos |
| **Q6 — Initial File** | `xcassets.sh` hidden in `.xcodeproj/xcuserdata/.xcassets/` — triple hex encoded |

---

## 🧬 Attack Chain

```
Developer clones trojanized Xcode project
    ↓
xcassets.sh executes (triple hex → curl bu1knames.io/a)
    ↓
C2 delivers 7× Base64 encoded AppleScript payloads
    ↓
looz: System profiling → POST /i
seizecj: Secondary profiling
cozfi_xhh: Apple Notes + Reminders theft → POST /n
txzx_vostfdi: Persistence
jez: Git pre-commit hook injection (propagation)
    ↓
Infection spreads to all local repos → shared with other developers
```

---

## 🌐 C2 Infrastructure

**Domain:** `bu1knames.io` · **Protocol:** HTTP · **Port:** 80

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/a` | Initial beacon + payload download |
| `/l` | Environment data |
| `/s/<name>` | Payload distribution |
| `/i` | System info exfiltration |
| `/n` | Notes/Reminders upload |
