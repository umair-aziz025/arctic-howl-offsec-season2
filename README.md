## 📖 About Arctic Howl

> *"The Cascade Expanse is no longer ruled by instinct alone. Ashka, an Arctic Wolf, was among the greatest cybersecurity hunters the Expanse had ever known – defending the Tundra Realm through instinct, reading subtle signals, sensing danger, and striking before threats could surface. When unusual activity rippled through the Tundra data center, Ashka moved to investigate but the adversary was already there. Two steps ahead. From the shadows, Ashka was struck down and taken. When the alarms faded, she was gone."*

Arctic Howl is a high-stakes cyber defense simulation featuring escalating weekly scenarios set in a frozen cybersecurity battleground. Throughout this Gauntlet season, challengers face an evolving adversary, uncovering the truth behind a missing guardian, a calculating adversary, and a chilling experiment that seeks to reshape instinct itself — blurring the line between hunter and machine.

**Only those who adapt will survive. Only those who endure will uncover the truth. And only the strongest will reach the heart of the storm.**

**Status:** COMPLETED &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** Malware Analysis · PCAP Forensics · IR &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Difficulty:** Easy &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Score:** 40/40

**Scenario:** At the Cascade Law Archive, a cold spike in outbound traffic appeared after a new developer cloned a starter Xcode project.

### ✅ [Week 2 — Expanse Surveyor](./WEEK%202%20-%20Expanse%20Surveyor)

<img src="./assets/expanse-surveyor.jpg" alt="Week 2 - Expanse Surveyor" width="100%">

**Status:** COMPLETED &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** Android Malware Analysis · HAR Forensics · APK Reverse Engineering &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Difficulty:** Medium &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Score:** 70/70

**Scenario:** An Expanse Surveyor installed a Research Gallery app (Fossify Gallery) on his Android device to organize expedition findings. Within 48 hours, anomalous outbound connections surfaced. Analysis of the trojanized APK and HAR network capture reveals a sophisticated Android malware campaign: GitHub Gist C2 resolution → 15x Base64 + XOR decryption → dynamic DEX payload loading → file reconnaissance → photo/video exfiltration → passive GPS tracking.

**Key Skills:**
- Android APK decompilation (JADX)
- HAR file traffic analysis
- Protobuf binary decoding
- Multi-layer Base64 + XOR decryption
- DEX payload extraction and in-memory execution analysis
- Android permission model and PASSIVE_PROVIDER GPS strategy

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ C2 resolution: GitHub Gist → 15x Base64 → XOR "blastoise" → `446d9f29543f.ngrok-free.app`
- ✅ Dynamic payload delivery via PayloadResponse protobuf + InMemoryDexClassLoader
- ✅ 3 DEX modules: FileScanner (recon), MetaDataParser (file theft), LocationTracker (GPS)
- ✅ Files exfiltrated: JPEG photo (Sony XQ-BC62) + MP4 video to `/api/backup/chunk`
- ✅ GPS anomaly: 12/15 geotag requests fail due to missing ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION
- ✅ Success window (20:45:20-20:46:20Z) correlates with YouTube activating GPS via PASSIVE_PROVIDER
- ✅ All 7 challenge questions answered correctly

**Novel Techniques Discovered:**
- 15-layer Base64 + XOR encryption for C2 address obfuscation
- In-memory DEX execution via InMemoryDexClassLoader (no disk artifacts)
- PASSIVE_PROVIDER GPS piggyback strategy to avoid background location permission
- Server-driven payload architecture where C2 controls all module execution
