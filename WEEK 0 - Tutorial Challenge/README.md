## 📋 Scenario

An IT department has detected unusual activity on a web server. The challenge provides:
- `tutorial.txt` — Base64-encoded message with a hidden flag
- `access.log` — Apache web server access logs from the last 48 hours

Your task is to extract the flag from `tutorial.txt` and then analyze `access.log` to identify how an attacker gained access to the server and what data they were able to steal.

## 🎯 Questions

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | What is the flag in tutorial.txt? | `TryHarder` |
| 2 | How did the attacker gain access? What data was extracted? | Path traversal attack — stole `/home/dave/.ssh/id_rsa` (1,678 bytes) |
